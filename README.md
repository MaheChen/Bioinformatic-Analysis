# Bioinformatic-Analysis
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this project is to apply statistics in bioinformatic research work to help fight cancer.</li>
<li>We will explore how to direct deleterious cellular states to transition into non-deleterious states by analyzing the typical cellular homeostatis of healthy and deliterious cells and the phenotypical transformation of cellular proteomic homeostatsis over time in response to different experimental conditions.</li>
