# Bioinformatic-Analysis
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this project is to apply statistics in bioinformatic research work to help fight cancer.</li>
<li>We will explore how to direct deleterious cellular states to transition into non-deleterious states by analyzing the typical cellular homeostatis of healthy and deliterious cells and the phenotypical transformation of cellular proteomic homeostatsis over time in response to different experimental conditions.</li>
<li>Our data set is available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m-bc56NfKErzkxdlHXBLWQg14W2R2vd8&export=download)</li>
