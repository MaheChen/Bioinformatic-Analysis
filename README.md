# Bioinformatic-Analysis

The purpose of this project is to apply statistics in bioinformatic research work to help fight cancer.

We will explore how to direct deleterious cellular states to transition into non-deleterious states by analyzing the typical cellular homeostatis of healthy and deliterious cells and the phenotypical transformation of cellular proteomic homeostatsis over time in response to different experimental conditions.

Our slides is reproducible using the provided .Rmd file.

Our dataset is available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m-bc56NfKErzkxdlHXBLWQg14W2R2vd8&export=download)
